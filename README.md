# A/B test project for online store

in this project we received an incomplete analytical task from an international online store : an A/B test was launched but the results were not analysied. we were left only the technical specifications and the test results, and 4 data files, in order to complete the analysis.

the project has several files:
- ab_project_marketing_events_us.csv - csv file contains the calendar of marketing events for 2020.
- final_ab_events_upd_us.csv - csv file contains all users who signed up in the online store from December 7 to 21, 2020.
